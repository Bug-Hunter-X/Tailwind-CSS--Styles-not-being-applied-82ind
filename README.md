# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components despite seemingly correct configuration and imports.

## Problem Description
The `bug.js` file contains a Tailwind CSS configuration that may not be correctly configured to include all the files which need to be scanned for styles. This results in Tailwind CSS failing to pick up and process the styles defined in your components.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file presents the solution by ensuring the `content` array in your Tailwind CSS configuration includes all files that may contain Tailwind CSS classes. The solution ensures that Tailwind CSS scans all necessary files to correctly identify and apply styles.
